GoldenGATE Markup Wizard



REQUIRED JAVA VERSION

Sun (r) Java Runtime Environment 1.5.0 or higher



STARTING THE PROGRAM

To start GoldenGATE Markup Wizard, you have several options:

- Double click GgMarkupWizard.exe

- Double click GgMarkupWizardStarter.jar (works on all operating systems if executing jar files is supported)

- On Microsoft Windows: execute GgMarkupWizard.bat (will invoke GgMarkupWizardStarter.jar)

- On Linux / MacOS: execute GgMarkupWizard.sh (will invoke GgMarkupWizardStarter.jar)

Starting GgMarkupWizard.jar directly may work, but is discouraged. In particular,
the prefixed starter process GgMarkupWizardStarter.jar is responsible for down-
loading and installing updates for the GoldenGATE core components, and starting
GoldenGATE Markup Wizard with specific parameters for the Java Virtual Machine.
Without these parameters, GoldenGATE Markup Wizard may run slowly or crash due to
lack of memory.
